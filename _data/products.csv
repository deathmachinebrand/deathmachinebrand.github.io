Vin Diesel can come too.<br></b>With the combo of our Death Core, a triaxial fiberglass weave complements the wood core by adding strength and creates the perfect flex for our snowboards. Combined with the Super Sundae Sidewalls + Death Core, the triaxial fiberglass strengthens the board (torsionally) to help the board keep its strength on turns and gives it the perfect flex. Fiberglass is such an underrated material - biaxial fiberglass makes a snowboard too soft, and basalt triaxial makes it (lighter but) too stiff.
